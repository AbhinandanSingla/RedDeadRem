                    Across the vast Western frontier, a plague is spreading...
                    When former outlaw John Marston wakes up at his farmhouse, he finds a world gone insane: overnight,
                    deranged hordes have overrun the towns and outposts of the American frontier. In a desperate attempt
                    to save his family, Marston must traverse a world torn apart by chaos and disorder, using every
                    skill he has to survive long enough to find a cure.

                the american frontier and its promise of freedom attracted people of all kinds:
                entreprenuers and outlaws, priests and prostitutes, vagabond and gentlemen.
                some made a home for themselves o the land, some fouund wealth at the end of a mineshaft, and other died
                penniless and friendless, or at the end of a gun.
                introducing some if the unique characters you’ve likey to meet in the world of red dead redemption.
